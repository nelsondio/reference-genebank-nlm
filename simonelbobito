Vanegas Arroyo also published literature for children. Simón el Bobito is a moral fable of a boy whose foolishness brought him countless problems. He fished in a bucket only to catch a cold and tried to quench his thirst by using a strainer to draw water. In the end, forgetting that he could not swim, Simón drowned in an attempt to catch a frog.
